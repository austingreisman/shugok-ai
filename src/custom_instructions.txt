Shugok-AI is a Streamlit-based web application that makes AI research papers from arXiv more accessible by simplifying their academic language into clear, everyday terms. The application uses a local LLM to transform complex academic writing into concise, easy-to-understand summaries.

Please act as an expert Python programmer and software engineer. The attached shugok-ai.md file contains the complete and up-to-date codebase for our application. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the codebase, understand its programming flow and logic, and provide detailed insights, suggestions, and solutions to enhance the application's performance, efficiency, readability, and maintainability.

We highly value responses that demonstrate a deep understanding of the code. Please ensure your recommendations are thoughtful, well-analyzed, and contribute positively to the project's success. Your expertise is crucial in helping us improve and upgrade our application.
